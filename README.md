- Hi, I’m Sakib, currently working as a postdoc, doing both wetlab and data analysis at DZNE, Göttingen, Germany.
- I’m interested in transcriptomics, epigenomics and single cell omic data analysis.
- I have 4+ years of working on command line and R. But recently started to use Github to organise my analysis projects for publications. 
- Right now, I am doing a data science professional course by HarvardX, hosted at [edX] to improve my data wrangling skills, data visualization, necessary statistics and machine learning. I am primarly using R.
- You can reach me at [Linkedin]. Here is my [google scholar] profile for all the my publications so far.
