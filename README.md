- Hi, I’m Sakib, currently working as a postdoc, doing both wetlab and data analysis at DZNE, Göttingen, Germany.
- I’m interested in the data sciences of transcriptomics, epigenomics and single cell omic data analysis.
- I have 4+ years of experience on working with command line and R. Recently I have started to use Github to organise my analysis projects. Most of them are still private repos, will be public once the papers are out. 
- Right now, I am doing a data science professional course by HarvardX, hosted at [edX] to improve my data wrangling skills, data visualization, necessary statistics and machine learning. I am primarly using R. You can see my progress [here].
- You can reach me at [Linkedin]. Here is my [google scholar] profile for a list of my publications.
